# translateR

## What is this?

This is a React.js web app that allows one to browse chinese language subreddits with pinyin translations appearing when highlighting any part of the posts. This is supposed to help people learn to read Chinese, especially for heritage speakers who might be able to understand a lot more spoken chinese and pinyin, but not the actual characters. This can be used in conjuction with the google translate extension on chrome-based browsers if one also needs to English translation.
